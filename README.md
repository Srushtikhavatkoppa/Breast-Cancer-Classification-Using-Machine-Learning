Introduction
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict binary outcomes based on input features. The model is trained and evaluated using a dataset loaded through Scikit-Learn. Logistic Regression is widely used for binary classification tasks, where it helps predict a probability for each class.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is accessed through Scikit-Learn’s datasets module. It contains features relevant for classification and a target label indicating the class for each observation. The project demonstrates loading, splitting, and preparing the dataset for training and testing.

Installation
To run this project, you need access to Google Colab. All necessary libraries are pre-installed in Colab, but if running locally, install these libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Project Workflow
The notebook follows these main steps:

Loading the Dataset: Loads and inspects the dataset’s features and target variable.
Data Preparation: Splits the data into training and test sets for model training and evaluation.
Model Training: Trains a Logistic Regression model using the training set.
Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using accuracy and other metrics on the test set.
Results Analysis: Analyzes and interprets the results to assess the model’s effectiveness.
Results
The Logistic Regression model achieves significant accuracy in binary classification. Results may vary slightly based on data splits and hyperparameters.
